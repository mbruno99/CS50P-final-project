# Project Description

Budget Pal is a command-line application designed to help users manage their personal finances simply and effectively.
The program allows users to record incomes and expenses, view a detailed budget report, and save data in a CSV file to maintain a history of transactions across sessions.
The main goal of the project is to provide an intuitive and straightforward interface, enabling users to categorize their transactions and have better control over their finances.

# Features

Income Registration: Users can enter various categories of income such as salary, extra earnings, investments, pensions, refunds, and gifts.
Expense Registration: Expenses can be recorded under categories like housing, groceries, transportation, healthcare, leisure, and debt.
Report Generation: Users can obtain a detailed summary of their incomes, expenses, and net balance.
Saving Data to CSV: The program allows exporting data to a budget.csv file, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
Input Validation: The system checks that user inputs are valid, preventing the entry of non-numeric or negative values.

# Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
project.py: Contains the main application code, including income and expense management and report generation.
budget.csv: A file generated by the program containing saved transaction data.
README.md: A document describing the project.

# Design Choices

Use of a Dictionary: I decided to use a dictionary called report for organizing users transactions because I found it easy to structure the data this way. It helped keep everything clear and easily accessible.
Input Handling with Loops and Validation: To ensure the programâ€™s robustness, I managed user inputs using while loops and error checks. This helped me avoid invalid entries and improved the program's reliability.
Use of the CSV Library: I chose to save the data in a CSV file, so users can keep a record of their transactions even across multiple program executions. This made the program more useful and long-lasting.
Number Formatting: To make monetary values clearer, I decided to display them with two decimal places. This ensures that amounts are precise and easy to read.
Modifying amount: If a transaction category already exists, users can modify the amount for that category.

# How to Use the Program

Run the Program: Execute the project.py file using Python.
Enter Transactions:
Type income to register an income.
Type expense to register an expense.
Type report to view a summary of transactions.
Type save to save data to a CSV file.
Type exit to save data and exit the program.
Interact with the Program:
After selecting 'income' or 'expense', choose a category and enter the amount.
If a category already exists, you can modify the amount.
Upon closing the program, data is automatically saved.
Review Saved Data: The budget.csv file will contain all recorded transactions.

# Requirements

To run this project, you need:
Python 3 installed.
The csv library, which is included in Python's standard library.

# CSV File Format

Data is saved in the budget.csv file in the following format:

type,category,amount
income,salary,1500.00
expense,rent,800.00
income,investments,200.00
expense,groceries,250.00

Each row represents a transaction with three columns:
type: Indicates whether it is an income (income) or an expense (expense).
category: The transaction category.
amount: The recorded amount.

# Conclusion

Budget Pal is an application designed to be intuitive and useful for managing personal finances.
It's simple yet effective implementation allows users to track their expenses in an organized and practical way.
